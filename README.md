This is a client project for communication between multiple persons in a local area network, and it's my homework project for the course named Computer Networks and Applications.

 **Something about the Repository**

- **Client**: There is a executable program file named *TCPClient*, and you can just double click the file to run the program.
- **Output**: The folder includes some main screenshots of the program when I used it to test.
